// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

const { mkdirSync } = require("fs");

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let number = 1;
// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
let total = 0;
// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100

while (number <= 100) {
    total += number;
    number++;
    console.log(number);
}

// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
 for (number = 1; number <= 100; number++) {
    total += number;
     }

    console.log(total);
